1. Consider the leftmost and righmost appearances of some value in an array. We'll say that the "span" is the number of elements between the two inclusive. A single value has a span of 1. Returns the largest span found in the given array. (Efficiency is not a priority.)

maxSpan([1, 2, 1, 1, 3]) â†’ 4
maxSpan([1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 1, 4]) â†’ 6
maxSpan([1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 4, 4]) â†’ 6

2. Given a non-empty array, return true if there is a place to split the array so that the sum of the numbers on one side is equal to the sum of the numbers on the other side.

canBalance([1, 1, 1, 2, 1]) â†’ true
canBalance([2, 1, 1, 2, 1]) â†’ false
canBalance([10, 10]) â†’ true

3. Say that a "clump" in an array is a series of 2 or more adjacent elements of the same value. Return the number of clumps in the given array.

countClumps([1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]) â†’ 2
countClumps([1, 1, 2, 1, 1]) â†’ 2
countClumps([1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) â†’ 1

4. We'll say that a "mirror" section in an array is a group of contiguous elements such that somewhere in the array, the same group appears in reverse order. For example, the largest mirror section in {1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 3, 2, 1} is length 3 (the {1, 2, 3} part). Return the size of the largest mirror section found in the given array.

maxMirror([1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 3, 2, 1]) â†’ 3
maxMirror([1, 2, 1, 4]) â†’ 3
maxMirror([7, 1, 2, 9, 7, 2, 1]) â†’ 2

5. Given two arrays of ints sorted in increasing order, outer and inner, return true if all of the numbers in inner appear in outer. The best solution makes only a single "linear" pass of both arrays, taking advantage of the fact that both arrays are already in sorted order.

linearIn([1, 2, 4, 6], [2, 4]) â†’ true
linearIn([1, 2, 4, 6], [2, 3, 4]) â†’ false
linearIn([1, 2, 4, 4, 6], [2, 4]) â†’ true
